## Dictionaries
*Dictionaries* are compound data types. More specifically, they are associative maps that correlate a key with a value. Think of them like lists, but instead of using a index to access its elements, you use a key.

Unlike indices, keys can have a variety of types. A key can be an integer, float, string, or a Boolean. Keys have to be unique. Values can have any type, and they can appear more than once.

Dictionaries are ordered in Python 3.7 and above, and ordered in Python 3.6 and below. They are ordered in the sense that they preserve the order in which elements are added. However, if you need an ordered data type, it is generally better to use lists, as the main point of dictionaries are they use of key-value pairs.

To create an empty dictionary, write:
```python
d = {}
```

To create a dictionary with things in it, write:
```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

To add an item, write:
```python
d['d'] = 4
```

To remove an item, write:
```python
d.popitem('d')
```

To iterate with a for-loop, write:
```python
for key, value in d.items():
  # do something
```
