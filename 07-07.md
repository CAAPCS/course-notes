## Computational Thinking
Computational thinking is an approach for solving problems. It is not a set method but rather a conceptual framework. Additionally, computational thinking is not limited to computer science; it is applicable to other fields.

Computational thinking consists of two components: *abstraction* and *automation*. Note that there are other ways to breaking down the process; this is just the way we are doing it in class.

*Abstraction* is the process of reducing a problem to smaller, more manageable, fundamental constructs. Generally, there is no one correct way to abstract a problem. Different approaches are better suited for different applications and operational constraints. Nonetheless, abstraction should always precede automation.

*Automation* is the process of mechanizing the abstraction. That is, it creates a series of automated tasks to deal with the elements produced by the abstraction.

## Elements of a Computer
There are a couple of ways to abstract a computer. In lecture we saw two.

First, we reduced a computer to its essential elements:
* Memory, both short and long term
* Processor, something to perform operations on the data in memory
* Display
* Interface

Second, we briefly touched on the computer abstraction stack. This is simply just the layers of abstraction from the electrons moving across transistors to the software you are reading this on. Lab 1 is simulating one of the lower layers of the stack.

## Binary
The *bit* is the smallest unit of information a computer can use, a single digit with the possible value of either 0 or 1. We can create larger units of information by stringing together bits. For instance, a *byte* is simply eight bits. With units these larger units, we are able to represent numbers larger than 1.

This is the binary system, and like base ten, it is a form of positional notation. In this case, the place values are powers of 2, and are either multiplied by 0 or 1. Consider the following example:
```
100110 = (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 38
```

## Boolean Arithmetic
Boolean arithmetic is a way of performing operations on binary truth values. The gates you will be building are simply implementations of the abstract Boolean operators. Below are the truth tables for the gates you'll have to implement.

| x | y |  NAND(x, y) |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|1|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

| x | NOT(x) |
|---|---|
|0|1|
|1|0|

| x | y | AND(x, y) |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|

| x | y | OR(x, y) |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|

| x | y | XOR(x, y) |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

Note: Here we used x_0 and x_1 instead of x and y for the sake of clarity.

| x_0 | x_1 | s | MUX(x_0, x_1, s) |
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|
|0|0|1|0|
|0|1|0|0|
|0|1|1|1|
|1|0|0|1|
|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|

| x | y | HALF_ADD(x, y) = (sum, carry) |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|(0, 0)|
|0|1|(1, 0)|
|1|0|(1, 0)|
|1|1|(0, 1)|

| x | y | carry_in | FULL_ADD(x, y, carry_in) = (sum, carry_out) |
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|(0, 0)|
|0|0|1|(1, 0)|
|0|1|0|(1, 0)|
|0|1|1|(0, 1)|
|1|0|0|(1, 0)|
|1|0|1|(0, 1)|
|1|1|0|(0, 1)|
|1|1|1|(1, 1)|
