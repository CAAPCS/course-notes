# Lecture Notes: July 12th

## Functions
Python interprets code linearly. That is, it executes code in the order in appears from the beginning to the end of the file. We can alter the flow of the program using functions. Using functions, we can create blocks of arbitrarily executable code.

A *function*, simply put, is a sequence of actions performed only when the function is invoked. Because of this reproducibility, functions also reduce redundancies in code and allow for the decomposition of problems into smaller pieces.

Consider writing a function whenever you find yourself repeating a snippet of code, or whenever you identify a discrete task within a larger problem.

## Objects
As mentioned in earlier lectures, it is possible to create one's own data types. In Python, a user defined data type is called a *class*. A class contains *attributes* and *methods*. Methods are operations that can be performed on the class, and we will learn more about these in future lectures. For now, we will focus on attributes.

Attributes are just the different data elements contained within a class. In practical terms, they represent whatever information remains after you abstract the object you are trying to represent. Consider a class meant to represent a point. Said class would need an X and Y attribute. What about a rectangle? Well, we could have attributes for a corner and the width and height. Or we could have attributes for two opposing corners. Or perhaps we want the possibility to represent quadrilaterals beyond rectangles and decide to have attributes for all four corners. All of this is to say that there are multiple valid ways to reduce an object to class attributes. The "optimal" solution will depend on the application and implementation constraints.

Note that classes are just blueprints for object instances. If we have a class called `Point` and two objects `a` and `b`, `a` and `b` are instances of `Point`.
Changing `a` or `b` will not change `Point`.

## Practical Odds and Ends

### Main
Many programming languages have a reserved function, `main`, that executes automatically whenever the script or program is executed. The main function serves as the entry point of the program. We can achieve the same in Python using the following:
```python
if __name__== "__main__":
  # do something
```
This gives us further control over the flow of the program.

### Indexing and Slicing
*Indexing* and *slicing* are the action of getting elements from an iterable data type (like a string or list) based on their index. The difference is that indexing is obtaining a single element whereas slicing is obtaining a subset of elements.

In Python, we can index and slice using square bracket notation. Square brackets with a single integer indicate indexing:
```python
>> a = "Hello world!"
>> a[1]
"e"
```

Square brackets with a colon and one or two numbers indicate a slice. The colon delimits between the starting and ending points. Note that the endpoint is non-inclusive:
```python
>> # a[start_point:end_point]
>> a = "Hello world!"
>> a[0:1]
"H"
>> a[0:2]
"He"
```

If the starting point has no integer, Python will simply begin at the beginning of the iterable. Likewise, if the ending point has no integer, it will end at the end of the iterable:
```python
>> # a[start_point:end_point]
>> a = "Hello world!"
>> a[:5]
"Hello"
>> a[6:]
"world!"
```

Lastly, we can use negative indices to count from the end of the iterable rather than the beginning.

|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|H|e|l|l|o| |w|o|r|l|d|!|
|-12|-11|-10|-9|-8|-7|-6|-5|-4|-3|-2|-1|

```python
>> a = "Hello world!"
>> a[-1]
"!"
```
