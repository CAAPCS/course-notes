## Natural and Formal Languages
*Natural languages* are those spoken by people and organically developed through usage and repetition over time. Natural languages have properties that make them unsuitable for communicating with computers. Among these are ambiguity, redundancy, and metaphor and other such non-literal forms. Understanding natural languages requires not only knowing what words mean, but also a theory of mind to navigate the aforementioned properties.

*Formal languages* are those designed and constructed for a particular application. Mathematics, chemical notation, and even traffic signs are examples of formal languages besides programming languages. Notice how all the examples listed above are designed to be terse and with little to no ambiguity. To this end, formal languages often employ strict syntactical rules at multiple levels of organization.

## Data Types
Data types are just how we interpret raw binary data. All digital data, from this document to the software you are using to read it, is just a string of ones and zeros--and types are just the constructs we use to organize it into meaningful structures.

Consider for instance the binary number `01101101`. As a one-byte integer, we can interpret it as the number `109`. But we can also interpret it as the character `m` or even as a color in an 8-bit color space like those found in older computers.

Basic, built-in data types are known as *primitive types*. Among these are Booleans, integers, long integers, floating point numbers, and characters. It should be noted that primitive types vary from language to language. For instance, C lacks Booleans and languages in the Lisp family have a symbol type which is absent in Python.

Primitive types can be combined to create *composite types*. Built-in composite types often include strings, arrays, lists, and dictionaries. But again, these can vary from language to language. For instance, C lacks strings, lists, and dictionaries. You can also design your own composite types to represent data that may not neatly fit any of the built-in types.
