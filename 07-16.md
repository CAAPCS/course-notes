## Object Oriented Programming
*Object oriented programming*  is a model of programming centered on organizing code around compound data types known as objects. According to the textbook, object oriented programs are possessed of the following characteristics:
1. Include class and method definitions
2. Computations are often expressed in terms of operations on objects.
3. Objects often represent real world things, and methods often describe ways of interacting with said things

## Objects
A way to think of *objects* is as the ideal and essential form of a thing. For instance, a book object would be composed of characteristics found in all books. In other words, it would be the essential form of "bookness" that all other books derive from.

## Classes
In Python, *classes* are a way to define objects. A class is a design or template for objects which specifies a particular set of attributes and behavior.

The attributes in question are defined by, well, attributes, whereas the behavior is defined by methods.

In Python jargon, an object is simply an instance of a class.
