## For-Loop Iteration
A *for-loop* is statement used to control the flow of a program by repeating, or iterating, a set of actions while some sort of sequential condition is met. By sequential condition, I simply mean any condition that is met in a sequential order. Think of an number incrementing until it reaches an upper bound, or moving through a list until we reach the end. Generally, we use for-loops when we know how many iterations we will perform.

The general form of a for-loop is as follows:
```python
# code before the loop

for <CONDITION>:
  <BODY>

# code after the loop
```

A more concrete example would be a simple loop to add all the positive numbers in a list.
```python
sum = 0
numbers = [-1, 5, 6, -8, 7, -11, 2]

for number in numbers:
  if number > 0:
    sum += number

print(str(sum))
```

## Lists
*Lists* are composite, mutable data types used to store collections of other data types. Besides being mutable, lists are ordered (meaning the items remain in a reliable order), iterable (can provide on element at a time), and allow duplicates. Furthermore, in Python, lists can consist of different types.

Lists can be defined by simply writing a literal expression or by using the `list()` constructor.
```python
list_a = ["a", "b", "c"] # literal
list_b = list(("a", "b", "c")) # constructor
```

Lists can also be constructed by using the `append()` method repeatedly.
```python
list_c = []

for i in range(8):
  list_c.append(i)
```

Besides `append()`, other common list methods are:
```python
insert()  # inserts element at a given index
pop()     # removes, or pops, element at a given index
remove()  # removes the first instance of a given element
sort()    # sorts the list
```

As mentioned earlier, lists are iterable. This is an important property for it allows us to loop over the list and select and modify one element at a time. In other words, instead of having to change the list entirely every time we wish to update it, we can simply modify the elements that need to be updated. To iterate over a list we can use loops.

In Python, for-loops are generally used for this task. An example of how to iterate over a list can be seen in the for-loop section.

## Notes on "Pythonic"
During lecture, Austin made a passing comment about how a way to code something was more "Pythonic" than another way. While tangentially related and perhaps a bit more of an intermediate topic, I suspect the idea of *idioms* will be useful, particularly if you ever find yourself stuck trying to figure out how to do something in Python.

*Idioms* are simply the favored ways of coding an action based on the particular language and its design. The actions in question are small recurring actions, like iterating over a list.

The reason why we have not really talked about idioms is that they can often be terse and obscure what is going on. If you are curious or would like a challenge, you can try and use them, but otherwise you can ignore them for the time being.
